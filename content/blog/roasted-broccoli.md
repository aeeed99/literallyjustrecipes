It's a pretty bold claim, but my methodology, developed over decades, is the only way I roast
broccoli. It's become a standard on my quest to get in more greens, which is otherwise quite a challenge
for me.

## The Four Agreements of amazing roasted broccoli are: Oil, Spice, Heat, and Position.

Let's get into each one.

### Oil ðŸª”

As in olive oil. Drizzle throughout the pan, being sure to touch up pieces that are dry (this is true for when
checking on the brocs mid-way). This is not a "spray and pray." It's **targeted**. Oil heats up in the oven and
helps to cook the broccoli through. It's also a sticking agent for the spices to latch onto. Which brings me
to the next agreement.

### Spice

As in: **salt, pepper, red pepper, flakes,** and **garlic** powder. Don't even _think_ about adding anything else
(and if you say honey you better gtfO). These four spices are more than enough flavor and are most likely already
stocked in your kitchen. Making this complicated gives you more excuses to skip out on your greens. We're going for
super simple, super easy, super delicious.

### Heat

As in: 425F in the oven. Non-negotiable. You want to get parts of the broccoli _charred_ ðŸ”¥ðŸ¥µ. Burnt ends in broccoli
results in a richer, deeper flavor. This principle of burnt bits extends to many cuisines as well, but broccoli has
a few types of "ends." There's the stems to burn, which makes it easier to bite into, and then there's the florets, which
is also soaking up the oil and spices. Searing this part a bit is the true secret to unlocking the best flavor. But the
point is: rotate your pieces, and get a nice even burn that's not too much in any one spot.

### Position

A principle in most baking, **oven position matters**. Set your rack to the top third, so it can be real close to the
intense source of heat.

Ovens are unique. You'll need to get to know yours. If you have a very large oven, you could play with setting the rack
even a bit higher. Experiment until you find whats right. Same goes for time in the oven. Regardless of what the [recipe](/recipes/roasted-broccoli/)
states, if it's not a bit seared, it can probably go in longer.

Microwaving rice is a very effective yet underappreciated way to make rice.
Brown rice requires a bit more heat and time.

## You will need

- A microwave safe dish or pan that's very deep.
- A cover for the dish or pan that can vent or left ajar.

## Steps

1. Wash 1 cup of brown rice, then combine with 1Â¾ cups of water.
1. If desired add a bit of salt or 1 tbsp of butter.
1. Cover, leaving a little bit of an opening for steam to vent.
1. Microwave on HIGH for 5 minutes.
1. Microwave on 50% Power for 15 minutes.

### Other tips
- Until you know your microwave, keep an eye on it as the water may boil over.
- The best way to save leftover rice is to freeze it; reheating it will recreate
steam from the freezer burn.

    "This recipe is more “assembling” than cooking. Ingredients are easy to prepare if they need to be prepared at all. If there is actual cooking, the amount of heat/time does not have to be too precise as there is room for error. This recipe can often be done while being distracted the whole time.",
    "Recipe is a good introduction to cooking, and is often some of the first recipes humans learn to cook. Ingredients may require some basic preparation (chopping at various sizes, mincing), and there may be one part where it’s important to focus on the dish to ensure the step is complete (such as making sure chicken is slightly browned). Simple baking is also included in this category.",
    "Recipe may require some previous cooking experience, but with enough confidence one can probably achieve the dish without it. There may be multiple large steps, some which may be recommended to be done simultaneously, and focus is a large factor. Some steps may require a bit of “instinct” to determine its done (e.g. smelling that aromatics (garlic))",
    "Recipe requires previous cooking experience with similar dishes to guarantee success. There may be 2 or 3 more steps to multi-task at the same time, or require very precise timing. Over- or underdoing some steps may result in failure that can’t be recovered from.",
    "These are expert-level recipes that often require formal training to guarantee success.",
